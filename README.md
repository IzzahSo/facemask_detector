# facemask_detector

Face masks are crucial in minimizing the propagation of Covid-19, and are highly recommended, even becoming obligatory in many situations. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, we propose a system that can therefore be used in real-time applications including easy deployment into existing systems to detect whether the public wear face masks or not. In addition, the system also could be integrated with embedded systems for applications in places to ensure the public safety guidelines are followed.

The Face Mask Recognition System is built with a very simple and basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow with Keras library and OpenCV to detect if you are wearing a face mask or not. The proposed system is also deployed using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts to detect face masks in static images as well as in real-time video streams
